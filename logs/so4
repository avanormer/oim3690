# Session 4 - [1/29] - [How Websites Work]

## What I learned today

When you type a website address (URL) into your browser, press Enter, computer follows a series of steps to find and display the website.

Entering the URL
- URL = is the address of a website.
- Computers don't understand names like “google,” so they're translated into numbers

DNS
- DNS (Domain Name System) = like the internet’s phone book.
- Translates the website name into an IP address (a numerical address).
- Tells the browser where the website is located.
HTTP Requests
- After finding the IP address, the browser sends a message to the website’s server.
- This message is called an HTTP request.
most requests are GET requests

Server Response
- Server= computer that stores websites.
- The server sends back:
  - HTML =page structure
  - CSS = styling such as colors and layout
  - Javascript = – interactivity

- The response also includes a STATUS CODE
STATUS CODES:
  - `200 OK` means the request was successful
  - `404 Not Found` means the page does not exist

Steps:
- Browser reads the files it receives
- Builds the page structure from HTML
- It applies styles from CSS.
- It runs JavaScript for interaction
