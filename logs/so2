# Session 2 - [1/27] - [Iterate with AI (Asynchronous Class)]

## What I learned today
- Email etiquette:  including course number in subject
  - Ex: "OIM3690: Question about GitHub setup") 

## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)
- File Navigation Codes:
  - cd folder = change directory (go into a folder)
  - cd... -= go up one level
  - dir = list files in a current folder
  - mkdir folder = make a new folder
  - pwd = pirnt working directory (explains where I am)
  

## Challenges I faced
 - originally challenging AI to make text into HTML and really getting into detail
for what was ideal

## AI usage (if any)
  - AI can turn HTML into text... How? 
= Ask AI to generate only index.html
  - Open username.github.io folder in VS Code
= Create index.html and paste the code
- Open index.html file directly in browser
- Open with Live Server extension in VS Code
Using the description below, generate a simple HTML file called index.html only.

***WHEN PASTING INTO AI, UTILIZE THIS PROMPT: 

I am [Your Name], a Babson College student.
[Paste your 2–3 sentences here.]

Requirements:
- One single HTML file (index.html)
- No external frameworks
- Clean and simple layout
- Include:
  - Header with my name
  - Short introduction
  - A section for skills or interests, ...
